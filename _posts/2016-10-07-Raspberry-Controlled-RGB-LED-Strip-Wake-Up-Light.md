title: Raspberry Pi Controlled RGB LED Strip Wake-Up Lamp
---

For a long time I've wanted a wake-up lamp. In our new appartment, there simply
isn't room for a traditional one. I'm sure there would be some commercial alternatives
for me, but I just felt like doing something with my Raspberry Pi.

So I embarked on a journey to make a Raspberry Pi controlled RGB LED strip wake-up lamp
that would fit on the shelf.
